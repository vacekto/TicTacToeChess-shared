# Ai
The Ai for tic tac toe uses [minimax algorithm](https://www.javatpoint.com/mini-max-algorithm-in-ai) with [alpha-beta pruning](https://www.javatpoint.com/ai-alpha-beta-pruning) optimalization to determine best next move. This was however motivated more by curiosity then practicality and has some sevire flaws that are so far left unaddressed. The evaluation function simply rewards longer streak for each opponent, which would suffice with enough processing power, but that is obviously unreasonable demand for client. Ultimate tic tac toe uses this algorithm in case when next game field is determined, otherwise it first randomly selects next game field. Chess uses third pary package [js-chess-engine](https://github.com/josefjadrny/js-chess-engine) for ai, but uses game logic implemented in shared repo.
